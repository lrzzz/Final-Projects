##Inspiration

>I intended to make a paper-cut style design. Paper-cut is one kind of Chinese traditional art and served as psychic medium in funeral and sacrifice ritual when it first appeared in Tang Dynasty. Due to its delicate pattern and auspicious meaning, now using paper-cut as window decorations becomes a new year custom in China, The semi-translucent decoration allows outdoor sunlight burst though the windows, at the same time, soften the light and create cosy atmosphere indoor.

>However, the pattern of most traditional paper-cut is too complicated and irregular to convert into programming language. The lines, curves and irregular shapes is hardly represented in a single equation. With the advice from Professor LeMasters, I decided to simplify the patterns into several concentrate circles and draw different kinds of regular shapes around the circles instead of animals, flowers even Chinese calligraphy.

>I get rid of the traditional red color of paper-cut and assign different colors to each circles of shapes. Here comes the problem that the color assigning part is cumbersome and there should be a condensed way to condense the code.

>Ask help from one of my Communication University of China alumnus Feng Pei, he suggested me take advantages of ArrayList in order to generate, store and read random colors instantly and dynamically.Thus I was enabled to try this possibility to create a parametric Gothic window pattern design. 

>Yes, window again. I cannot get rid of window this time.
